## Installation

Follow these steps to install Jupyter Notebook and set up your environment:

1. **Install Python:**
   - If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Install Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open your command-line interface (CLI).
   - Run the following command to install Jupyter Notebook using pip, Python's package manager:
     ```
     pip install jupyter
     ```
3. **Verify Installation:**
   - To ensure that Jupyter Notebook is installed correctly, run the following command in your CLI:
     ```
     jupyter --version
     ```
     You should see the Jupyter Notebook version displayed.
     
4. **download the repo:**
   - To ensure that Jupyter Notebook is installed correctly, run the following command in your CLI:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/hackThacker/DataAnalysis.git
     ```
     You should see Download files displayed into your download directory extract that then go to next step.
     
5. **into files directory  :**
   - Into files directory there are many lots of .csv files for given practise.
   - You can used this files for practise also  :

6. **Now go into report folder:**
   - To ensure that you installed correctly, run the following command in your CLI:
   - Running this command will instruct pip to install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    - After the installation process is complete, you can verify that the packages were installed successfully by running
      ```
     pip list
       ```
     - you have .csv files into your report folder and rename the files  which you want to generate report into html from csv files to analysis dataset.
       ```
     python dataset.py
      ```
    
    

7. **After report go to  analysis folder :**
   - Modify accoding to your .csv = into jyupter files.
   - first read report which is generated and read each things and then what you want to analysis first clear on it.
   - after you read report then into analysis folder there is jyupter files run jupyter :
   - from your download folder run jupter then .csv files also into that same analysis folder
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
     This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

## Opening Files

Once Jupyter Notebook is running, follow these steps to open a file:

1. **Create or Navigate to a Directory:**
   - You can create a new Jupyter Notebook by clicking the "New" button and selecting "Python 3" (or another kernel of your choice).
   - To open an existing Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb), navigate to the directory where the file is located.

2. **Open a Notebook:**
   - Click on the notebook file you want to open. This will open the notebook in a new tab where you can edit and run code.

3. **Working with Notebooks:**
   - You can add and edit cells in your notebook to write and execute code.
   - To run a cell, select it and press Shift+Enter.
   - Save your work regularly by clicking the "Save" button or using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S on macOS).

 ## Usage

1. **Import Python Libraries:** Import essential Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

2. **Import CSV File:** Read a CSV file ('customers-100000.csv') and store it in a Pandas DataFrame ('df').

3. **Number of Columns and Rows:** Retrieve the dimensions (rows and columns) of the DataFrame using `df.shape`.

4. **Top 5 Rows:** Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using `df.head()`.

5. **DataFrame Info:** Provide detailed information about the DataFrame, including data types and missing values, using `df.info()`.

6. **Drop Unrelated/Blank Columns:** Remove the 'Status' and 'unnamed1' columns from the DataFrame using `df.drop()`.

7. **Check for Null Values:** Calculate the sum of null values in each column using `pd.isnull(df).sum()`.

8. **Drop Null Values:** Remove rows with missing values from the DataFrame using `df.dropna()`.

9. **Change Data Type:** Convert the 'Amount' column to an integer data type using `df['Amount'] = df['Amount'].astype('int')`.

10. **Check Data Type:** Check the data type of the 'Email' column using `df['Email'].dtypes`.

11. **DataFrame of All Columns:** Retrieve the list of column names using `df.columns`.

12. **Rename Column:** Rename the 'Marital_Status' column to 'Shaadi' (not applied to the DataFrame) using `df.rename()`.

13. **Describe Data:** Generate summary statistics for numerical columns using `df.describe()`.

14. **Use Describe for Specific Columns:** Generate summary statistics for specific columns using `df[['Email', 'Company', 'Country']].describe()`.

15. **Plot Bar Chart for Gender and Its Count:** Create a bar chart showing the count of each 'Country' value using Seaborn.

16. **Plot Bar Chart for Gender vs. Total Amount:** Create a bar chart showing the total amount vs. gender using Seaborn.

17. **Plot Bar Chart of Gender:** Create a bar chart showing the count of each 'Age Group' value, labeled by counts and differentiated by gender.

18. **Total Amount vs. Age Group:** Create a bar chart showing the total amount vs. 'Age Group'.

19. **Total Number of Orders from Top 10 States:** Create a bar chart showing the total number of orders from the top 10 states.

20. **Total Amount/Sales from Top 10 States:** Create a bar chart showing the total amount/sales from the top 10 states.

21. **Marital Status:** Create a bar chart showing the count of each 'Marital_Status' value, labeled by counts.

22. **Marital Status of Gender:** Create a bar chart showing the sum of 'Amount' for each combination of 'Marital_Status' and 'Gender'.

23. **Occupation:** Create a bar chart showing the count of each 'Occupation' value, labeled by counts.

24. **Total Amount by Occupation:** Create a bar chart showing the total amount for each occupation.

25. **Product Category:** Create a bar chart showing the count of each 'Product_Category' value, labeled by counts.

26. **Total Amount by Product Category:** Create a bar chart showing the total amount for the top 10 product categories.

27. **Total Orders by Product ID:** Create a bar chart showing the total number of orders for the top 10 most sold products.

28. **Top 10 Most Sold Products:** Create a bar chart showing the top 10 most sold products.

  You can used many files for learning into files directory there are many csv files are located
